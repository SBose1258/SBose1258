**Interactive Dataset Querying Chatbot with OpenAI API**
Welcome to the Interactive Dataset Querying Chatbot! This project leverages the OpenAI API to create a conversational chatbot that enables real-time interaction with datasets, allowing users to query, classify dynamically, and cluster data on the go.

**Project Overview**
This project is an exploration of prompt engineering using Python, aimed at designing a chatbot that makes dataset exploration interactive and insightful. With the power of the OpenAI API, users can seamlessly inquire about the data, uncover patterns, and gain insights without needing deep technical knowledge.

**Key Features**
Interactive Data Querying: Engage with the dataset conversationally, asking questions and receiving responses in real time.
Dynamic Classification and Clustering: The chatbot applies prompt engineering to classify and cluster data based on user queries.
Real-time Insights: Instantly query the dataset for insights and observe data trends without complex processing steps.
Tools and Technologies
Python: The backbone of our development, used for integrating the OpenAI API and building prompt flows.
OpenAI API: Core API for natural language understanding, prompt engineering, and data interaction.


update on Nov5,2024: Still figuring out the chatbot 
Update November 6, 2024: I figured out the chatbot, it is responding to general queries .. Yay!!!. need to specify it to the dataset.
